Creating Dog Classifier 

1) Steps needed 

There is a template provided within this Artificial Intelligence Project that loads all
datasets and provides structure for the entire project. 


2) What to install/configure
 
 Install Jupyter notebook version 2.6
 Use image training and testing datasets provided
 Import the libraries listed in the notebook
 
 
3) What to know 

This notebook provides code that accepts any user provided image.  If a dog is detected,
it estimates the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it estimates the dog breed it 
most resembles.  

The notebook is broken down into these eight steps:

Step 0: Import Datasets
Step 1: Detect Humans
Step 2: Detect Dogs
Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
Step 4: Use a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
Step 5: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
Step 6: Write your Algorithm
Step 7: Test Your Algorithm
